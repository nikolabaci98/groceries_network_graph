# Analysis of Supermarket Items Bought Together

Supermarkets have no discounts when it comes to twisting our psychology to get us to buy more.

From one-way entrances, to immediately seeing the vibrant colors of fresh produce and smelling the baked goods, to the music they play in background, everything is planned to keep you shopping as long as possible.

One famous trick employed by supermarkets is to place items that are generally bought together far apart from each other. This forces the customer to walk by aisles and #buy products that they did not plan for.

Below, is a network graph of products that are generally bought together. The darker the line the more frequent are they bought together. The colors represent communities, basically the items that end up together in the shopping cart.

Next time you go grocery shopping pay attention to the layout and see if you can willingly prevent yourself from this psychological trap.

P.S. never ever go to shopping with your stomach empty, you will end up buying everything you see and makes your mouth water.
